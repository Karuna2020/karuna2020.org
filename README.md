## üí° How it works

1. Every day, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Karuna2020/karuna2020.org/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-site.yml) triggers a build
2. We fetch data from our [Open data](https://github.com/Karuna2020/open-data) API endpoints
3. The built site is pushed to the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/Karuna2020/karuna2020.org/tree/gh-pages) branch
4. It is deployed by GitHub Pages on https://karuna2020.org

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development

This website is based on [Emergency Site](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site) and therefore has the following features suited for COVID-19 websites:

-   Static files generated by Eleventy
-   Optimized for first connection roundtrip
-   One critical request with inlined CSS
-   Offline support with service worker

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
