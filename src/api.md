Our goal is to be completely transparent with our data, including contributors, beneficiaries, and processes. You can use our Open Data API to programmatically access this data, sourced directly from our [GitHub](https://github.com/Karuna2020/open-data) repository, and updated every 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Our Open Data API, as the name suggests, is completely open — CORS-enabled, with no rate limits, authentication, or fees. Show us what you build!
